We are continuously looking to expend our feature set. Because this project is not funded it's hard for the Space Robotic's group of the University of Luxembourg to support the whole of this development. Hence we would love the community to help us build new features. But also to tell us what are the features you'd like to see! We list below the features/improvements we'd like to push forward in the near future.
